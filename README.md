> Self-learning Algorithm Implementation - Includes High-Precision Computation, Dynamic Programming and Advanced Sorting Algorithms

## Implemented Algorithms

### High-Precision Computation
- **Large Number Addition**: Handles arbitrary-length integer addition
- **Large Number Subtraction**: Supports negative results detection
- **Large Number Multiplication**: Implements schoolbook multiplication algorithm

### Advanced Sorting Algorithms  
- **Quick Sort**: Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting with O(n log n) average case
- **Counting Sort**: Non-comparative sorting for integer data with O(n + k) complexity
- **Merge Sort**: Stable sorting algorithm with guaranteed O(n log n) performance

### Dynamic Programming
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Identifies the longest increasing subsequence in an array
